sift algorithm on image

The scale-invariant feature transform algorithm is an algorithm that is used to find certain properties in image analysis, regardless of the size of their counterparts in the picture (also assumed unspecified, independent of the cartesian or cyclic position in the picture).

Object tracking application can be done by determining the location of the object using sift.
